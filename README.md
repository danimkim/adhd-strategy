# ADHD Dev Strategy

A practical guide and interactive toolkit for ADHD developers to overcome project paralysis and build sustainable momentum.

## 🎯 Overview

**ADHD Dev Strategy** is a web-based resource designed to help developers with ADHD (or similar executive function challenges) complete their projects. It combines research-backed psychological strategies, behavioral techniques, and structured execution systems into an actionable guide.

### The Problem

Many ADHD developers experience a familiar pattern:
- ✅ Start projects with excitement and momentum
- ✅ Build initial features successfully  
- ❌ Hit a wall when repetitive work begins
- ❌ Struggle to restart after interruptions
- ❌ Project remains incomplete despite effort

This isn't a character flaw—it's how ADHD brains are wired. With the right system, you can finish your projects.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Psychological Strategy** - Reframe failure as debugging, not shame
2. **Behavioral Strategy** - Design work to match how your brain actually works

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 10+

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🌐 Internationalization (i18n)

The site supports multiple languages with automatic detection and manual switching.

### Adding a New Language

1. Create translation file: `client/public/locales/[lang]/translation.json`
2. Add language to i18n config: `client/src/i18n/config.ts`
3. Update LanguageSwitcher component if needed

Example structure for new language:
```json
{
  "nav": {
    "title": "ADHD Dev Strategy",
    "strategies": "Strategies",
    "execution": "Execution"
  },
  // ... rest of translations
}
```
